WINDOWS 10 BATCH VIRUS


requirements: WINDOWS 10

# HEY!
I am not responsible for any damages caused to your computer, including boot damage, or startup registries that force the batch file to open right on startup!
**YOU** are the one who ran the file and **YOU** are the one who downloaded the file!

This isn't a worm.

It is most recommended to use a **VIRTUAL MACHINE** that can run Windows 10. I recommend **NOT** using this on your host PC.
